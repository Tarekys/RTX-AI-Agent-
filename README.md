RTX Graphics Card Procurement Project

Project Overview

This project is designed to identify and evaluate the best NVIDIA RTX graphics cards available in the Egyptian market through an automated, AI-driven process. The workflow leverages a series of AI agents to collect, analyze, and present data in a comprehensive web-based report.

Key Features





Objective: Source the top RTX graphics cards in the Egyptian market based on price, specifications, and availability.



Agent Workflow:





Four AI agents operate sequentially, with each agent passing its output to the next in the pipeline.



Each agent generates independent results, ensuring modular and verifiable data processing.



Final Output: Results from all agents are aggregated to create a professional procurement report, presented as an interactive web page.



Cost Efficiency: The estimated cost per agent, including all API usage, is approximately $0.44.



Scalability: An optional fifth agent can be added to review and refine the final report for improved accuracy and quality.

Purpose

The goal is to assist in making an informed purchasing decision by providing a detailed comparison of RTX graphics cards, tailored for personal use in the Egyptian market.
