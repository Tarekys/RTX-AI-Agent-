## Project Overview

This project is designed to identify and evaluate the best NVIDIA RTX graphics cards available in the Egyptian market through an automated, AI-driven process. The workflow leverages a series of AI agents to collect, analyze, and present data in a comprehensive web based report.

### Key Features

- **Objective**: Source the top RTX 5070 graphics cards in the Egyptian market based on price, specifications, and availability.
- **Agent Workflow**:
  - Four AI agents operate sequentially, with each agent passing its output to the next in the pipeline.
  - Each agent generates independent results, ensuring modular and verifiable data processing.
- **Final Output**: Results from all agents are aggregated to create a professional procurement report, presented as an interactive web page.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The estimated cost per agent, including all API usage, is approximately $0.44.
- **Scalability**: An optional fifth agent can be added to review and refine the final report for improved accuracy and quality.

### Purpose

The goal is to assist in making an informed purchasing decision by providing a detailed comparison of RTX graphics cards, tailored for personal use in the Egyptian market.
